# Problem 1

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which
missing data is an issue. Then, do or answer the following (commenting
on the results of each):

### Data Exploration

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa") #Load NOAA data from the datasets library
```

The dataset “ny_noaa” consists of 2595176 rows and 7 variables, which
are: id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin. These variables describe
each observation through its ID, date observed, and the levels of
precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and maximum/minimum temperatures.
From the summary statistics of this dataset, missing data is an issue
for the weather variables (precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and
temperature extremes) due to the amount of NAs present.

Tmax and Tmin have tmax and tmin, which have 1134358 and 1134420NAs,
respectively.

Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are
given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly
observed values? Why?

### Data Cleaning and Observations

``` r
ny_noaa = mutate(ny_noaa, date = ymd(date)) #convert dates to Date format so it can be manipulated
ny_noaa = mutate(ny_noaa, year = year(date), month = month(date), day = day(date)) #I can't use the pipe operator because R won't add the columns - ask in office hours
#Created separate variables for year, month, and day and converted minimum/maximum temperature variables into 

#Most commonly observed values for snowfall 
```

Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and
in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
interpretable structure? Any outliers? \### Average Maximum Temperatures
in January and July By Station and Year

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) \###
Maximum vs. Minimum Temperatures

``` r
# Tmax vs Tmin
```

### Distribution of Snowfall

make a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0
and less than 100 separately by year.

``` r
#Distribution of snowfall values by year
```
